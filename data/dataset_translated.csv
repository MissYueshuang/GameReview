As a kid, I always wanted to have a dog but I was always influenced by my relatives to not have one. With time I grew up and started working and one day I saw a picture posted by my friend and there I saw a little dog. I asked him if he was for sale and he said yes.

I didn’t have any money at the time to buy the dog so I asked him if he could wait. Every day I asked the Universe to give me money for the dog. It really worked and my dog is sitting in my lap right now! I don’t know how it worked, but I do know that I am so grateful for it. Ever since that day, I believe!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!",2020-10-21 22:20:28
"It was October of 2018.
I had my dog with me for 4 months. Not once did she climbed up on my bed at night. Not once in 130 days. She was trained that way.

This particular night I was sick. I had bad fewer and terrible cold. I already took off the day before from my office. I was shivering from cold. Somehow I managed to sleep at 2.00 am. Suddenly I felt something warm. I realised the bed was occupied and I have little place to move. I looked out in the dark. I already knew what it was.

My dog came and slept by me. She felt the temperature and maybe that is the reason she wanted to give me care. I was taken back. I used to stay alone with my dog. She did what other human would have done. Cared.",2020-10-21 12:10:14

"Once, I had a pet named BURNIK and he's a dog btw. This all started when my cousin's dog named HOTDOG (yes again LOL. I'm very close to my cousin.) gave birth to puppies : D. My cousin gave me a dog, he has black fur and oh boy he was cute when he was a puppy! This puppy was so weak that I had to nurse her with lots of milk because the mother died giving birth to 15 dogs. He was one feisty drinker that gave me some appetite eating more everyday because i usually eat less. He was abandoned by her mother without consent that made me think that having parents is a gift. Then i kissed my mother and father who were there feeding BURNIK as well. It just gives me reason to live fully to know that there are people who are less fortunate than us. I hope my story isn't boring : D

As we see Attila the gun was so focused on that thing, Tomoe Gozen was treated that thing in a funny way while Helen of Troy was so little scared of that thing.
Yushitsune and Boudicca was observe the thing on what's going on while Brynhild having a strange feeling on that thing.
And finally Merlin do some magic on that thing.
Maybe it is an illustration on that strange round thing was going to metamorph into something.
And it would be a dragon coz that strange thing is a dragon egg.

Everyone is so excited to harness the power of Glyndwr and to witness the breath taking scene except Brynhild. She senses that something is wrong.

Initially they were gathered as companions to enjoy a good time, have a good time and tell their experiences against some heroes until Tomoe Gozen makes a joke in a mocking tone challenging Merlin, at first this was not going to more but Attila the Hun continued the game doing anger Merlin; Hippolyta and Minamoto are intrigued by how all this will end while Brunhilda will go on the defensive since she is affected by Merlin's powerful magic, Attila excited by Merlin's demonstration just waits for this to be the first step to a not so friendly combat , Tomoe for his part laughs at Merlin's easy temperament, finally Helena as well as Hippolyta and Minamoto joins to see who will be the winner.",2020-10-23 15:33:53

"Able Fable was a miserable old man, who was always worried that someone would break into his house and steal all his money. Each night before he would go to sleep, he would lock his wallet up in a safe located near his bed so that if anyone were to try to rob him they would have to wake him up to do it. Unfortunately, on the night that Able died he had only placed the wallet on the table near the safe without locking it up. Before his death, Able said to his family and friends that none of them were to touch his home or his money and he said that anyone who came near his safe and wallet would be greeted by his ghost and be scared away. Following Able's death the family decided that the money in the Fable house was not doing any good if not used, so they went into the home to get it.
Able's oldest son decided to make the first attempt. He opened the door and went in, he saw Able's wallet on the table and reached for it. Immediately he heard a voice say:
""I am the ghost of Able Fable, put the money back on the table!""
The voice scared the son so much that he ran from the room and out the door, screaming: ""I heard the voice of a ghost!""
The oldest daughter in disbelief decided she would make her way into Able's room. She entered and reached for the wallet.
She then heard the voice say: ""I am the ghost of Able Fable, put the money back on the table!""
The daughter was so scared that she dropped the wallet and ran from the room screaming: ""I heard the voice of a ghost!""
The youngest son decided to make his attempt at getting the money. When he entered the room and reached for the wallet he also heard the voice say: ""I am the ghost of Able Fable, put the money back on the table!""
The youngest son decided that he was not easily scared and said back: ""Well, I am the ghost of Davey Crockett and the money is going to stay in my pocket!""

The youngest son took all the money for his own and the ghost of Able Fable was never heard from again!",2020-10-24 02:17:10

Arthur and Merlin have a very close relationship, more like a father/son or grandfather/son. Really, though, their relationship is a bit different than a father and son, they are more like friends to each other than a father and a son would be. When Arthur gets older, Merlin becomes his advisor. At the end, when Arthur is very old, he sees Merlin in a dream.

When Uther fell in love with Gorlois’ wife, Igraine, Merlin helped the king, by transforming Uther to resemble Gorlois (duke of Cornwall). When Gorlois died, Uther married Igraine, but she was already pregnant.
According to the earlier authors about Arthur (Geoffrey of Monmouth, Wace and Layamon), apart from his involvement in the incident of Arthur’s conception and Merlin’s foretelling of the Britons defeating the Saxon with the help of the future king (Arthur), Merlin was never present during Arthur’s reign.

However, many later writers say that Merlin was involved in Arthur’s education. According to the French writer, Robert de Boron, at Arthur’s birth, Merlin gave the infant to Sir Antor (Malory called him Sir Ector) to raise the child in obscure fosterage. Antor was the father of Kay, later a knight who served as his foster brother’s seneschal.

When Uther died it was Merlin who informed the barons of Logres that only a person, who could draw the sword from the stone, would be the rightful king. Merlin was largely responsible for putting the crown on Arthur’s head. Some lords were discontent when only Arthur could draw the sword. Merlin was also involved with Arthur, providing strategy to win the war against the rebel barons. See Birth of Arthur (Vulgate version) and Kingship and Early Wars.

When Arthur broke this sword that had named him king in a fight with King Pellinor (Pellehen), Merlin brought Arthur to the lake where he received a new sword from the Lady of the Lake. This sword was the true Excalibur (see New Sword in Legend of Excalibur page). Merlin told the young king that the scabbard was better than the sword, because it would prevent him from bleeding from his wounds.

Later Morgan le Fay would steal the scabbard (see The Conspiracy of Morgan le Fay in Legend of Excalibur).

Merlin wasn’t only an adviser to Arthur. In the Didot Perceval, he aided Perceval in several adventures. In Suite du Merlin, Merlin had unsuccessfully tried to guide Sir Balin.

Merlin foretold of the greatness of Lancelot and Tristan, though Merlin had died shortly after Lancelot was born.",2020-10-16 15:18:17

"Good evening gentlemen Admin!

It was King Arthur at the beginning of his legendary reign, it is said that if it were not for Merlin, King Arthur would never have ruled Camelot so wisely ... Although that is only a legend of the reign since according to the Breton specialist Jean Markale :
Merlin is a multifaceted figure who personifies different archetypes of the Celtic mythical world; like the druid, the bard, the wild man, the shaman and the prophet.

The legend of Merlin comes from two fundamental historical sources: The Lailoken tradition and the story of Ambrose the Child.",2020-10-16 10:43:34

Merlin in general was Arthur's tutor. With the death of Arthur's father Great Britain was left without a king. Merlin had buried a sword in a rock and on that sword it was written in gold letters that whoever managed to remove it would be king. Many tried but it was Arthur who withdrew.,2020-10-17 06:18:18

"Merlin was king Arthur’s most trusted advisor, prophet, magician, friend and fatherly figure.",2020-10-17 00:43:06
There can be many gossips about Merlin but I know one truth. So have you ever thought where all that magic comes from? Fortunately or unfortunately its from his father who was a demon. I said unfortunately because it makes Merlin a half-demon... Also fortunately because his spells helped Uther to sneak into queen Ygerne's room by shapeshifting to the kings look. Thats how Arthur's born. Merlin took care of him as a foster father until Arthur revealed his identity by drawing the kings sword from the anvil -or rock as you know- which's Excalibur itself. So we can easily say Merlin was as close to Arthur as any father could be to his son.,2020-10-17 05:44:17

"Merlin is a warlock, the last Dragonlord in existence, the only son of Hunith and Balinor, Gaius's ward and apprentice, and the best friend and manservant of the late King Arthur. Unlike most sorcerers, Merlin was born with the ability to use magic. 

Merlin originally had an antagonistic relationship with Arthur. He believed him to be nothing more than an arrogant bully and even said that he'd help anyone who wanted to kill him. However, this changed after he found out that they were linked by destiny and he decided to save Arthur from Mary Collins's attack.

Arthur, on the other hand, trusted Merlin with most of his secrets. Despite their differences, however, Merlin and Arthur quickly developed a grudging affection for one another. As time went on, Merlin gradually began to take on the role of Arthur's unofficial advisor.

Merlin was Arthur's advisor and had eventually become his bestfriend.",2020-10-18 02:35:25

2. Elemental buff, the effect is so small that it does not affect the game. So no significant changes in the game, not that important.

3. New immortals, i will say this is for cash purchase only, havent tried. I suggest to make all immortals available in market thru souls purchase. Cause some are also gems only immortals.

4. Boss hunt changes is the best changes in the new version, this will make dragons level up faster. Lols

5. Search for gnomes level is also ok, bad side of this players will no longer going around to search for farming levels, move to just hunt boss.

"Hi Game Dev, 
I like the concept of putting elements into play however this makes your troops limited to immortals with certain type of element and there's no synergy where you can mixed up elements or maybe have a certain type of upgrade stones where you can change the element of the immortal.
Upgrades takes longer and speedup reliant not very good for f2p players.
AP and SP regen takes too long to replenish this lets player easily off the hook since there's not much in the game meant for grinding. - easiest way to attract spenders is to attract f2p players popularity will always rack up sales. If you will stick with this there should be a way of minimizing the cost of each attack. Like allies can rally gnomes or rally cities or rally a boss. This will boost time spent in game and camaraderie eventually would increase likeliness of inviting friends to play the game.
There should be a free 2nd builder that's unlockable by either certain vip level or by reaching certain level of city hall. this is common to every strat game.
Ruins is fun time killer but scout is limited. It should have its own building that's upgradeable to increse march speed and number of scout - spy is very reliable in every war game.
We can't view members of other alliance by clicking on their guild.
I'm not sure of how the arena match making is done it's still imbalance.
Dragons are quiet good concept - when auto fighting their skills should be optional to be clickable or auto as timing is your best ally.

"The Ruins are a great idea, they give decent stuff and keep us playing the game for hours, Elemental buffs should have bigger impacts tho. Like make it increase the trigger rate of skills, for example a skill has a 55% stun rate. Now when you have 5 of the same element it increases that probability by 5% can also work with dragon skills making us focus elemental affinity.

"Comment: I love the 4 new immortals, Kudos for the ruins exploration, it is a great idea for those who really spend time on the game, they can do exploration on the map while waiting for upgrades to be done without experiencing boredom, and the best part of the update is Elemental auras, that really caught my attention, that is really a great idea to promote team Elemental composition..... oh and by the way i also love the update for legendary immos, you can now equip 3 skills for full 7 star immortal. That way it is now much powerful than purple ones! Coz i remember before, 7star medb is a lot usefull than my 7 star Cleo",2020-09-22 16:21:07

"Strategy center, nice. I did puck up a lot of hints in the chapters of the ruins. Even the Keeners and day oners would appreciate some direction to their curiousity. Picking an immortal is one thing but which armoured Toto to wear 😂 misplaced equipment on an immortal can cost days and resources. Changing line ups should be researched wisely, throw a query on the chats players always have great advice, on your alliance or not.

ELEMENTAL synergy is your best ally. Always lead a troop with atleast 3 same elements that will par with your DRAGON.  Adding a healer type immortal wont hurt your line up. If you do not know how your build will be always practice with Gnomes and see which is your best pick so far.,2020-09-29 15:00:05

Good idea to make a solid 1 element troops.

My opinion the best would be water element,

Ramses + Atilla + Merlin + Helen = OP

water have good range and good nuke magic immortals. And great if you can get Ramses that allows your troops to be more durable in battle. The effects of your immortals great affect the battle, - atk speed of Helen, silence of Attila and Disarm of Ramses. 

And add damage and heal skills in tower of knowledge
-support, grace (heal) 
-meteor, silence, stray arrow, root (damage)
-garote, nova, cblade (area dmg)

Surely you will be top10 in arena ranking with this line up.",2020-09-30 13:25:18
"Yi syeon ge, Peter the great and Richard 1 are good lightning elemental trio, paired with a super high lightning dragon/taranis lvl that has max lvl of skills and lvl 25 super adult dragon gives 4 percent bonus damage and -4 received damage. Pair it with another healer like moctezuma or zenobia and have max stars for each immortal. Max plus( the one that you upgrade when you use materials from the well of time) for them is good as well. Don't forget to have a very high level of troops to support your team  soundly. Rush your castle to have higher level of troops. Don't forget the talent book as well for the military side, I personally prefer the critical talent because this team/my team is damage based and stun based.",2020-09-29 15:32:24

"I must admit, the STRATEGY CENTER is a big help, not only for pioneer players but specially to new players that are confuse and no where to go where to start. From Elemental Aura explanation, Unit recommendation, immortal list, dragons and its skills are well provided,  equipment rarity and allocations, good counter illustration, down to the most important factor of the game ""Tower of Knowledge"".
A very user friendly website. Thumbs up 👍.
Hope in the near future, you would also incorporate in this site on how the castle siege goes, like the mechanics or explanation about castle, town cities etc... A lot of new players are confuse about it and keep on messaging me privately.",2020-09-29 14:02:55
"A very good idea, unfortunately the display of the page on the smartphone is a bit not transparent and it would be necessary to work on it here, many people wonder on what levels the gnomes can get, so it would be great if there was an outline of it.

 The next step that would be useful when planning a development strategy are the levels of buildings and their requirements.

 The rest of the really great job was missing that especially when you start the game, you really are developing in a great direction.",2020-09-29 15:12:20
"I was struggling and problematic these past few days with my main team because I always want to one shot a level 2 Boss and hit hard on sieges, but I can't do it with the team that I built. I kept on experimenting, already 'Reborn' a lot of my immortals to see which composition will be best for my team. Then good thing this Strategy Center came today and now I have a guide to which immortals to use for my team to achieve my goal. This Strategy Center is a big help because most of the immortals that I have is in the recommendation but I'm not using some of them in my troops, might try to use the recommended immortal line up to see if it works for me.
Since this is new and you guys will keep on updating this, I hope to see more guides like:

Stats of every immortals in different level, different +, different diamond count and with different equipment.
Comparing different immortals of the same role type. For example, you only have two Attack Immortal, Alexander the Great +5 level 25 and a freshly summoned Spartacus. You want to know if Spartacus will have a better stats if he's on the same level and + as Alexander because you saw that Spartacus has a good Energy Skill, so in that case you'll be tempted to Reborn Alexander. If that simulation will be in Strategy Center, you may save some Gems and time waiting for the Reborn timer in case you realized that Alexander is better for your team and you should've not used Reborn to see Spartacus stats.
I also want to see more info about Bosses around the map like how many HP does a level 1 Metallic Fortress has, how about a level 2 and what is the recommended Power to take them down like what is shown in Well of Time. Also information about the differences about Chests that will drop from Boss, how level 1 Gray chest is different from level 1 Blue chest and so on.",2020-09-29 15:50:44
Build immortal with the same element and upgrade all of the equipment,2020-09-30 01:49:31
There's a good healing combo with Arminius and Moctezuna that I would suggest.,2020-09-30 15:34:52
"I'm very positive towards the creation of the STRATEGY CENTER. This is really convenient to those players who prefer to figure things out themselves, and I can say this because I'm one of them. You don't wanna bother asking your leaders or the other members about the basics of the game everytime, and this is where I find the STRATEGY CENTER most helpful. Even if you are already a veteran of the game, there are times that you need to revisit the basics. 

Also, the STRATEGY CENTER will help lessen the work load of the leader and the officers of an alliance. At times, we message our leader/officer to seek advice about our lineup. Now that the strategy center is here, it's gonna be a huge help for the leaders to manage their alliance efficiently, simply by directing the members there. But of course, you can still ask the other members or the officers.

Currently, what we have in the STRATEGY CENTER are the basics about Immortals, Dragons, Equipments, Units, Elemental Aura, and Skills. Now that Infinity Kingdom is growing and improving, there are lots of features and improvements that will surely be added in the future, in addition to the most recent ones, and for sure we cannot memorize all of them. This is why it's a must to visit the STRATEGY CENTER when there's uncertainty in your heart about any game-related issue that you might have.",2020-10-01 00:41:18
"It's a good idea. You should also add an FAQ area because lot of people don't know how they can get better equipment and so on. 

Also the performance for smartphone users should be optimized, a lot of graphical problems are here. 

After all it's a nice idea and is really helpful to understand the games mechanics",2020-09-29 15:35:59

I think the water dragon is very good precisely because of the composition of water not having a healer but I think that precisely for that reason the healing skill should affect everyone.,2020-10-11 10:43:34

I have him at lvk 18 now and im a little underwhelmed with the healing and freezing chance is too low 🙏 otherwise the skills and concept of the dragon is pretty good and a force to be feared",2020-10-11 05:04:35
"Glyndwr is an amazing dragon. It is also very useful in all sort of situation, Arena, Gnome hunting even in boss raid, name it. It can freeze enemies which boost water element type immortal, specially Merlin since it can double its ultimate's damage at the same time it can heal your wounded allies in front. More importantly its 3rd skill, making your water element immortal much more powerful. Can you imagine +1.7% damage increase per skill that can stack up, up to 5 times. How cool was that!.",2020-10-10 11:41:59

CONTROL CHANCES IS VERY LOW.,2020-10-10 11:11:08
WATER DRAGON IS REALLY GOOD AT SUPPORTING THE UNITS WITH THE UNEXPECTED HEAL WHEN THE IMMORTALS ARE LOW PLUS IT GIVES GOOD PHYSICAL DAMAGE AND I HOPE YOU INCREASE THE MAGICAL DAMAGE AT LEAST MAKE IT EQUAL WITH PHYSICAL SINCE THE IMMORTALS WITH WATER ELEMENTAL DEAL MORE MAGIC DAMAGE. THEN AGAIN I HOPE YOU INCREASE THE FREEZE PERCENTAGE OF THE WATER DRAG AND LOWER THE WATER CRYSTAL TO DOMESTICATE THE SKILLS SINCE THE CHANCES OF GETTING BIG CHEST AT KILLING A STINGER IS SO LITTLE SO AT LEAST BE CONSIDERATE OF THE NEWBIES BUT OVERALL WATER DRAG IS A GOOD SUPPORTIVE DRAG.,2020-10-10 12:30:28

"Glyndwr is a very good dragon indeed i mean u get a nice heal but I think it should heal a smaller amount but the entire team, and it has a bug to on lvl 2-3 on both skills(that I alrdy reported so ir can be fixed) i hope that bug gets fixed because it s sad when u spend alot of crystals and u don't get nothing in return.
Sugestions
Lower health percentage(but heal the entire team)
Grow the freze percent on second skill a little bit or just grow it more and change it to freeze just 2 immortals, and I would give a bigger bonus for the ones with a full element team, hope my feedbacks helps a little bit, thx and a nice game so far hope it will improve in many aspectos!",2020-10-11 05:30:18
"I feel that it would be better if his healing skill would affect all heroes and I believe that's kinda pointless that frost breath upgrade from lv.1 to lv.2 has no changes. Overall it's great a dragon to start with, since you'll have helen and possibly get merlin.",2020-10-10 19:10:40
"To be fair, wind dragon is better than water dragon because wind dragon lifesteals and heals and deals damage which water dragon does not. If I were you, wind dragon is the way to go but eh. xd 
Increase the percentage at which the freeze hits and idk make the back lines heal as well for the first skill then it would match the wind dragon.",2020-10-10 11:49:46
Glyndwr my first dragon he would have a great skills but somehow skill lvl2 and skill lvl3 as the same amount. Also at freezing too. Is it a bug? And freezing amount chance too low. I think its better if effect on two enemies but higher chance like more than 50% on lvl1 otherwise this skill is useless.,2020-10-10 16:21:52
It's a good amount of heal and perfect for a water team since they lack a good healer and so Glyndwr fulfill this job in a water team. One of the best dragons even. If it's the first one to obtain,2020-10-10 15:44:16
The mist hides Glyndwr the healing dragon. He's calm and dangerous which viciously freezes your opponents in times of trial and will provide you undisruptive healing for your frontline in times of battle. The mighty Glyndwr will never let you down as the frost hungers for the enemies.,2020-10-10 15:55:25

"this is the first dragon you get, since it is water element, it will heal your troops and freeze enemies on its first 2 skills. but as with all dragons it is hard to get shards from boss kills because of the latest update. boss monsters can no longer be rallied and stay on the map for only a specific amount of time, so hunting for them will be harder since you will have to consider your relocation time to get to them or use up so much ap to hit from afar. hope they bring back the old method to hunting bosses.",2020-10-10 12:24:10

I think good a idea about boss rally but according to chest color is not good because the highest lvl of boss the chest I got is low but I think  when u refer the chest color to highest lvl of boss I think is good,2020-09-20 10:34:00
"The new update is very good and very fluid. It has some bugs, but I'm sure it will be perfect soon! Keep up the good work!!! 😉👍",2020-09-20 05:02:25
I liked the new version of rally. It has alot to offer even if you lose you still get something out of it. Another thing is you can damage the boss 3 times with just single attack that really saves a lot of time.,2020-09-19 13:48:50
"The rally is difinity has a high social value for the alliances for sure and it brought alliance players together for a short period to hit some big bosses, when the raids formed up the rallies helped lower ranks hit the next level boss, a Hugh need for the up and coming players. A different reward option for the rallies? I'm inpatient and for the better part would solo, I love it.  So Solo, and Rallies on bosses should both be available?",2020-09-20 00:04:40
"well, it's my first time doing the boss battle coz I just started 2 days ago. so far I found it cool specially low level boss keeps spawning near my base 😆 it's a shame that there's a limit for the treasure box, if there's none, I will have lots of box in my treasury lol",2020-09-19 21:54:27
"This is better, Makes the boss hunt faster than before.

Im wondering if we can solo hunt though the level10 boss? Would this be possible by using the multifold dmg attack?",2020-09-20 08:31:23
I love solo Bosses as that bro does!!!! Plenty of dragon chests! I never have time to waste now! And I mainly search for Death stinger because I have to raise my baby water dragon. It is too cute to be put on the battlefield,2020-09-19 13:45:45

I like the new version because i can kill the boss when i want 😎,2020-09-19 13:47:47
"I like the new System, seems to be better for Alliance with different Timezones. So you don't always make a specific Time to Kill Bosses, now you can do it alone! So it's really good!",2020-09-19 23:24:15

"I would like to join the Tianzun system is full service at the same time attack the same boss no troop loss, only statistics at the same time each player's output value will have a gift the higher the ranking to the better the reward. Boss won't fight back, and refresh once a week If you can't finish playing this time, you can play next week and the blood volume of boss will increase every month I think the output match will be fun",2020-09-19 18:11:27

"Charlemagne or Charles the great has been called the ""Father of Europe"" (Pater Europae), as he united most of Western Europe for the first time since the classical era of the Roman Empire and united parts of Europe that had never been under Frankish or Roman rule. His rule spurred the Carolingian Renaissance, a period of energetic cultural and intellectual activity within the Western Church. The Eastern Orthodox Church viewed Charlemagne less favourably due to his support of the filioque and the Pope's having preferred him as Emperor over the Byzantine Empire's first female Empress Irene of Athens. These and other disputes led to the eventual later split of Rome and Constantinople in the Great Schism of 1054.

almost all people use this immortal and its very OP, i strongly suggest to nerf this immortal so that we can have fair game. pairing him with a healer immortal makes him ""IMMORTAL"" in game. its best to pair him with healer and burst damage immortal like Merlin, Seigfried, Saladin, Empress Wu, etc.

Tower of knowledge
add skills on add physical and magical defense for early to mid game, late game you can also use aura skills that reduce abilities to enemy immortals.

PLS. NERF THIS CHARLES THE GREAT
and BUFF all normal immortals green, blue, purple immortals.",2020-08-04 17:17:04

Pioneer server 1 has this problem everytime you open the research. Idk maybe it's just my gaming phone,2020-09-08 21:31:31
"I've downloaded the pioneer server last night and I'd like you to know that it's not a good impression to see existing alliances there when you are about to start your journey as a new player. I was told that Pioneer server is just a ""test server"" and that you are luring us in there with the rewards you are offering for the new version.

For what? For the statistics you need just like what you've been telling us and for the players to spot the bugs of the game and send them to you. You guys are just using us to fix the game issues before its official release.

Do you know why you have to encourage players to play in the Pioneer server? It's because of the fact that you've been creating several beta servers which lead players to jump from their current server to the new one. Instead of launching the game globally.",2020-09-08 15:51:40

"Infinity Kingdom... My suggestion concerns the occupation of cities.  The City Evolution System could be implemented, just 1 Level above.  Ex: from Level 1 to level 2, from 2 to 3 and so on.  With time, the lower level ends up losing its importance, the objective of the becomes the higher level.  As a result, these cities are abandoned.  Generally, nobody cares much about protecting Level 1 cities. With the possibilities of evolution, they would be more important.",2020-05-26 22:48:20

"Hi, I choose Ruslan's Kingdom, basically for 3 reasons:

1-My friends are in it;
2-I had already played in the kingdom Ydvia on the pioneer server;
3-He is the most beautiful king of the 3 and still reminds us of ""The Chronicles of Narnia"".

Unfortunately, the initial prizes were only in the kingdom of Ydvia, even so, Ruslan was my choice and the choice of the BR community. We are looking forward to the arrival of servers in America and the translation of the game into Portuguese! strong hug!

"Mine is Ruslan Kingdom which has a color red. Red is a very powerful color not only it symbolizes love but also passion. In addition to that, it has a lion in it which is one of the strongest animal in the world. Lion is a very elegant animal. It can be a very strong competitor but at the same time it can be very friendly depends on how you treat a lion. Ruslan Kingdom is like me, I’m passionate with everything I do and I try to be strong to be like a lion. Also, my best friend chose the same kingdom. 😊

Make sure to leave your tips and ID while also tagging #tips 😊,2020-04-29 16:30:45
"Here are my tips:

1. Be active. Everything starts from here because this will determine your progress in the game. Being active does not equate to being present. Being active means that you are up for activities with your fellow lords. Communicate with them whenever you have questions, suggestions, feedback, and tips. Ultimately, participate in rallies and raids.

2. Be one. We have our own ideal formation of troops, especially the immortals that we'd like to use, but there's are two things that we need to decide on as one - those are the ""Technology"" and the ""Territories"". Deciding as one in choosing technology has a great impact on how fast your alliance will level up. If you are not aware, each territory offers city bonus. Watch out for the city bonus that will be beneficial for your alliance.

3. Enjoy the game and have fun. Don't be stressed when you think that you are behind. Seek help. We have Facebook, Instagram, and Discord. One way of improving your gameplay.

"I met some friends who came from the pioneer server.  However, over the days they gave up on the game.  Only one server left the game uncompetitive for those who started later and unattractive as well.  Repeated events, and the fact that the game was not released to the rest of the world, greatly disrupted the players' experience.  Please create new servers and extend the game's release to other regions of the planet, before the game dies!",2020-05-24 06:54:09
"My tips to catch up to veterans are to focus on upgrading your castle so you can have high tier troops early and you can use it as a advantage to occupy high level city compare to other players. And you can always spend your gems in the hall of immortals because even you don't get the epic immortals, you can sell the fragments you get in summoning immortals then you can have soul crystal and you can use it to buy items in market 😉

5 Finish campaign, levelup ur hero rush and upgrade it asap
6 buy stamina and ap for more campaign raid more stamina more experience you receive, you can load more troops the higher the level and upgrade
7 level up your 2nd and 3rd troops to load more resources
8 raid enemy for more honor additional attribute to your immortal and plunder resources

"If you want to gain alot of honor very fast. Go teleport to other alliance place then provoke them to attack you. The more player attack you the more honor you will get. 15mins is enough to gain 100k honor points as long as you deffend your base succesfully (pick the guild that has a lot of weak alliance members). Garrison your main troops ofcourse

Another tip.. attack Other player resource gathering camp much easier rather than attacking the main castle. Because usually resource gathering camp troops mostly are the weak troops (batch 2,3) unlucky if it is the main troop hahah

Ps: resources is just a bonus ,🤣😁

V - VISUALIZE - always think outside the box of how are you going to maximize your resources specially your GEMS, you can spend a thousand of it to reach VIP6 so that you can build faster, and then spend some of it by summoning an immortals in hall.

I - INNOVATE - Learn how to change plans and ideas specially in game, This applies when you are already part of an ALLIANCE , you need to strategize (City Siege) every decisions and suggestions for the benefits of every members. ( what time to attack , when to migrate , what city to siege )

"Wow, an interesting question! 😃
I've spent hours trying to find as many clues as I can for this puzzle. Here is what I found so far regarding the Piosopher stone and its link to the World Heart:
 The Boss Gnome at the start of the storyline mentions the importance of Philosopher stone saying ""...Keep my Philosopher Stones well..."" meaning that these stones even in small quantities are extremely precious and valuable. 🤩
Right after the story, we see a powerful Royal Alcamyst restore an entire crumbled city using a single stone. Seeing the shock Grace ( the women that give tips to the player) mentions: ""Come on, Duncan. That's Philosopher Stone. Now you see it and should know why Gnomes army comes."" this makes it clear that the Philosopher stone is not only valuable but also of great magical power. 🧐
Finally, we meet Mr. Horace another Royal Alchemist who introduces us to the ""well of Time"" a mystical portal that allows the Imperial army to go back in time and reclaim lost battles/cities using the Philosopher stone. This is the biggest hint with regards to the ""World Heart"" which explains that this sole city controls the greatest balance for power in the region. Obtain this city alone would be enough to immediately take over any opposing force. 🤯
